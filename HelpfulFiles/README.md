# Helpful Files for Students
Included:
- My currently used .vimrc (the thing that makes Vi/Vim easier to use)
  - To use my .vimrc (which I use on Unix/Linux/MacOS) you need to run the following line in the terminal:
    - git clone https://github.com/csmezz/csce240-f17-001/blob/master/HelpfulFiles/.vimrc
    - If you don't currently have git installed on your computer, 
  - Mine is fairly basic since I don't use overly complicated functions.
  - For more information on how to customize the .vimrc -> https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html
  
To be added:
- alias commands to help with testing code
- .bashrc information
