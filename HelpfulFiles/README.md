# Helpful Files for Students
Included:
- My currently used .vimrc (the thing that makes Vi/Vim easier to use)
  - How to use my .vimrc in your system:
    - Move to whichever directory you plan to use for your work in CSCE 240 (or to your root with "cd")
    - Run the following command:
      - wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/csmezz/csce240-f17-001/master/HelpfulFiles/.vimrc
    - Remember that files and folders (in Unix/Linux/MacOS) with a "." in the front are hidden, 
    so it won't show up with basic commands such as "ls"
  - Mine is fairly basic since I don't use overly complicated functions, but feel free to edit it and
  customize it for yourself.
    - The command for editing your .vimrc is:
      - vi ~/.vimrc
  - For more information on how to customize the .vimrc -> https://dougblack.io/words/a-good-vimrc.html
  
To be added:
- alias commands to help with testing code
- .bashrc information
