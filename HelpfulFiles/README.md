# Helpful Files for Students
Included:
- My currently used .vimrc (the thing that makes Vi/Vim easier to use)
  - How to use my .vimrc in your system:
    - Run the following commands
      - cd
      - touch ~/.vimrc
    - .vimrc is a hidden file, so it won't appear if you use "ls", with the editor of your choice,
    copy all of the data from the "sample_vimrc.txt" and paste it into the new ".vimrc" file.
  - Mine is fairly basic since I don't use overly complicated functions, but feel free to edit it and
  customize it for yourself.

To be added:
